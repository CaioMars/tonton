## Automated Tests

**Note:**
When running the automated tests a warning might appear in the log as such:

      ‚óè  Cannot log after tests are done. Did you forget to wait for something async in your test?
      at Icon (/tonton/node_modules/@expo/vector-icons/build/vendor/react-native-vector-icons/lib/create-icon-set.js:82:36)

This is a known issue between Jest and @expo/vector-icons that has open tickets at GitHub. It can be ignored and more investigation is required.
